                                    About Conference. There have been growing divides in housing provision among different income groups in especially urban areas. While most high income groups can enjoy higher quality of housing and are able to choose where they live, poor people are too often left with no option but to live in neighborhoods of concentrated urban poverty with severely limited accesses to urban services. Slum, as an indicator of inequality in cities, is not the only area which suffers from disparities. Many people also lack accesses to essential infrastructure facilities, such as safe and affordable water supplies, adequate sanitation systems, reliable and friendly public transportation, and durable houses.
